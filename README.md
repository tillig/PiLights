# Pi Lights

Raspberry Pi hosted website for sending commands to [rpi-ws2812-server](https://github.com/tom-2015/rpi-ws2812-server) for LED control.

This was primarily created as a personal project to get some fun WS2812B lighting strips going in my house and enable control via a web/mobile app. I'm not planning on supporting it, though you can look through it to see how I did things.
